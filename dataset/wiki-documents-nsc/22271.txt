CRC: Uncertainties of several degrees should generally be assumed. (e) Indicates extrapolated values beyond the region of experimental data, subject to greater uncertainty. (i) Indicates values calculated from ideal gas thermodynamic functions. (s) Indicates the substance is solid at this temperature. - Ref. CR2: The equations reproduce the observed pressures to an accuracy of &plusmn;5% or better. - A conversion factor of log 101325 is included into the original first coefficient of the equations on this page to provide the pressure in pascals. Valid results within the quoted ranges from most equations are included in the table for comparison.ReferencesCRC References. CRC. As quoted from various sources in an online version of:- David R.
